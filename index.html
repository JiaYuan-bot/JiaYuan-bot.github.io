	<!-- Biography -->
	<div class="col-md-10" style="height: 100vh;">    
		<h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2>
			I am working at Tencent's Database Research and Development Department for two years. I am part of the AI4DB project team,
			which is a joint collaboration with 
			<a href="http://idsm.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/">Intelligent Data Storage and Management Lab</a>,
			leded by <a href="http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/zhouke2/en/index.htm">Prof. Ke Zhou</a>.
			I previously studied at Sun Yat-sen University, majoring in Computer Science. 
			I completed the majority of the courses (92%) in 2.5 years. After that,
			I had a brief internship experience at the Big Data and Computational Intelligence Research Institute at Sun Yat-sen University, 
			under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan">Prof. Xiaojun Quan</a>.
			And then I started self-learning database management systems and extensively studying AI-related knowledge. 
			After completing my junior year, I joined Tencent and have been researching AI4DB until today.<br><br>

		<h2 id="Research Interest">Research Interest</h2>
			Over the past decades, the amount and velocity of data available to the enterprise is accelerating,
			cloud service providers typically maintain millions of database instances, 
			and this scale is expected to continue rapidly expanding in the future. 
			Managing, securing, tuning, detecting anomalies, and resolving issues for such a massive cluster is extremely challenging
			and may even be impractical for DBAs and database developers.<br>

			In the meantime, AI research has also made significant breakthroughs. AI exhibits strong capabilities in learning from and modeling
			large amounts of data, as evidenced by its successful applications in computer vision and natural language processing, 
			leading to substantial commercial success. The integration of AI with large-scale data management systems holds tremendous
			research value, but it also faces numerous challenges that need to be overcome. I am committed to conducting research
			in the field of AI4DB and breaking the frontier between AI and large-scale industrial-grade database management systems.

		<h2 id="Work/Research Experience">Research Projects</h2>
			<h4 id="Query Optimization - Cardinality Estimation">Query Optimization - Cardinality Estimation</h4>
			• Cardinality estimation is crucial for the database optimizer to generate execution plans, especially for index selection.
			It is a fundamental yet long-standing problem in the field of query optimization that has not been fully resolved.<br>
			• Since we are not ready for learned cardinality estimation and take into consideration of the master-salve design of instance.
			Finally, I proposed a method of using TOP K frequencies instead of sampling to build histograms on the slave node for cardinality estimation . 
			Test results have shown that this method achieves 40% higher accuracy in cardinality estimation compared to the original histogram approach in
			MySQL. Statisticing the top K frequency for massive data may be very memory intensive. Based on the SpaceSaving
			algorithm, I propose a more optimized data structure to achieve memory controllability and time complexity of O
			(n) for efficient streaming processing of large amounts of data.

			<h4 id="Anomaly Detection">Anomaly Detection</h4>
			• For large-scale database instances in the cloud, relying on manual discovery and analysis of anomalies
			is not feasible. It is crucial to have the capability of automated anomaly detection through
			the combination of machine learning algorithms and DBA expertise.<br>
			• First phase of the project is 7x24 hour anomaly detection for all cloud instances. I implemented a demo version of
			the anomaly detection framework and tested various temporal data anomaly detection algorithms.

			<h4 id="cdbtune - Project Phase 2">cdbtune - Project Phase Ⅱ</h4>
			• The Tencent Cloud Database AI for Database project team has published two research papers on database self-tuning
			at SIGMOD conference: “An End-to-End Automatic Cloud Database Tuning System Using Deep Reinforcement
			Learning” and “HUNTER: An Online Cloud Database Hybrid Tuning System for Personalized Requirements”.
			These papers focus on the optimization of database performance through advanced techniques such as RL.<br>
			• The productized version of these research findings is known as cdbtune. In cdbtune project phase Ⅱ, which I am
			responsible for, I have further enhanced the system’s optimization capabilities. Specifically, I have upgraded the
			tuning process from being based on sysbench/TPCC benchmarking to utilizing real user workload for more accurate
			and personalized performance tuning.

			<h4 id="Workload Generation">Workload Generation</h4>
			• Workload generation is defined as generating a representative workload from a given workload. However, current research
			in both academia and industry primarily focuses on ensuring relative sequential consistency of transaction execution,
			thereby overlooking conflicts between subworkloads under concurrency. <br>
			• I have collaborated with Dr. Baoqing Cai, the first
			author of the paper “HUNTER: An Online Cloud Database Hybrid Tuning System for Personalized Requirements” to
			jointly develop a workload generation project. Currently, the research paper of this project is in the process of being
			submitted. Additionally, I have taken the lead in commercializing the workload generation, and its benchmarking
			capability has already been utilized in the cdbtune Phase 2 project. The workload replay capability can achieve over 90%
			similarity to the original workload, and it is now widely used for internal anomaly diagnosis, performance testing and commercial proof-of-concept
			(POC).
